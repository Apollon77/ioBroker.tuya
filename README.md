**This adapter uses Sentry libraries to automatically report exceptions and code errors to the developers.** For more details and for information how to disable the error reporting see [Sentry-Plugin Documentation](https://github.com/ioBroker/plugin-sentry#plugin-sentry)! Sentry reporting is used starting with js-controller 3.0.

ioBroker adapter to connect to several small and cheap Wifi devices that care connected to the Tuya Cloud and mostly use the Smartlife App/Alexa-Skill. The adapter supports reading real time status updates and controlling of those devices once synced with the respective mobile phone app.

Beside devices usable with the Smart Live App or Tuya App.

The adapter locally connects to all devices that are "always in wifi". Devices that only come online when there is an event, send their data and go offline again (mostly **battery powered devices**) are only supported using the Tuya IoT Platform MQTT connection (see below).

One adapter instance can locally discover and connect to all devices in a network that routes UDP packages! For Docker environments this requires additional actions and potentially Macvlan or similar!

## Functionality: Local-only vs Cloud Supported Features

This adapter can, if wanted, mostly work without the Tuya Cloud. 

If this is wanted a one time synchronization with the Tuya Cloud App Account is needed as soon as new devices are added. This can be done be entering the cloud credentials in the adapter config and clock the "synchronize one time" button. It is not needed to store the cloud credentials!

**Note: When the App Sync is done it might be that the Tuya Mobile app informs about a login from an Android device into the Tuya Account. This is from the Adapter!**

The adapter then will listen for local UDP messages to find the local IPs of the devices and establish a local connection. This is only possible when the Tuya App is NOT open on any device because most devices only allow one local connection.

If you decide to store your Tuya App Login Credentials (Smart Life App or Tuya Smart App) in the adapter configuration then the devices are updated with each adapter start automatically. Additionally the states of devices that are not connected locally can be polled and controlled via the Tuya Cloud.

To support real time updates of devices that are not connected locally, and also e.g. battery based devices, you can additionally register yourself an Account on the Tuya IoT Platform and Link your App Account and use a Cloud-MQTT connection. To register yourself an Account on the Tuya IoT Platform please follow the instructions on [Tuya IoT Platform](https://developer.tuya.com/en/docs/iot/Platform_Configuration_smarthome?id=Kamcgamwoevrx).
**Note: The IoT Platform Account is only active for some time and needs to be extended monthly afterwards!**

If you use the Tuya IoT Platform and get the message in log like "Use app cloud polling because last MQTT update was 29 hours ago. Please check your Tuya IoT Cloud status that no service is expired." then this means that there were no MQTT messages in the last time and so most likely the iot Core Service has expired. Login to the Tuya IoT Platform and check the status of the iot Core Service. If it is expired then renew it (possible monthly directly or up to 6 months with a manual review process by Tuya staff.

With this featureset you can choose between all available options and work with or (beside the one time syncs) without the Tuya Cloud systems. You decide.

The "former" App-Proxy-Sync is still available in the Adapter Config but not recommended anymore. It is much easier to do the new One Time Cloud Sync.

### If UDP discovery do not work
If the devices are not correctly detected via their UDP packages you can set the IP manually by setting the ip state of the device to the correct IP.
The former alternative is to edit the device object. See https://github.com/Apollon77/ioBroker.tuya/issues/221#issuecomment-702392636

### Note for Battery powered devices
As already told above Battery powered devices are not supported by this adapter when using only local connections! The reason is that they are not online all the time to save power. Whenever they get a signal, they go online, send the update to the the Tuya cloud servers and go offline again. They do not emit any UDP packages or are online long enough so that the adapter could connect to them.

By using the Tuya App Cloud feature data can be polled, but this might be still not enough for door/window/presence detectors. They should work only with the Tuya IoT Platform MQTT connection.

## Proxy-Sync (Fallback): Compatible Mobile Apps and versions
The currently versions of the Tuya Smart and also Smartlife App are **no longer compatible** with the way the adapter works because Tuya encrypted all traffic that the adapter could sniff. For now still some older versions of the Apps work ...

* Smartlife App <3.14, best 3.12.6!!
* Tuya Smart App <3.14, best 3.12.x
* STL Smart Home App 1.1.1 (last dated Sept 2019)
* Ucomen Home App (??)

**Important Note for iOS Users:** The Proxy approach described here is not working anymore. As soon as you have Smart Life App version 3.10 or higher the communication from App is no longer visible to the proxy. But it still works with all Android App versions, so the best approach is an Androis Emulator as roughly described at https://forum.iobroker.net/topic/23431/aufruf-tuya-adapter-tests-verschl%C3%BCsselte-ger%C3%A4te/19

To do this first of all you need to add a custom Root-Certificate on your mobile device.
When you click "Start Proxy" in the adapter instance configuration the certificate is created for your system and shows a QR-Code to the download location. Ideally scan the QR Code with your mobile device and follow the process to add and trust this Root-Certificate.
If the QR code location is not reachable (may happen when use Docker or such) then open the "Proxy Web Info Port" in your browser and click on "Root-CA" in the navigation and you can download the CA File too.

Now make sure to close/kill the respective Tuya smart app.
After that add the Proxy-Port and the ioBroker host as "Manual" Proxy for your WLAN connection on your mobile phone.

Now open the respective Tuya Smart App and/or reload.

The Admin configuration will show a success message if the relevant data packet was received and will then turn the proxy off 10 seconds later. You can now remove the proxy from your phone and also untrust the certificate.

Directly after this the objects should be updated with more meaningful names and receive live updates from then on automatically and should be able to communicate.

The sync is only needed initially or after you added new devices to your App.

Some images for some mobile OS can be found at the [Proxy-Page](PROXY.md).

## Devices that do not deliver up-to-date data
We discovered some devices - most likely devices with power/current states - that can have the effect that they only show up-to-date values when the mobile app is connected to them. When the app is closed they stay on the old values.

These devices currently only work via "polling interval" in most cases. They do not deliver up-to-date values by themself. You can try to work around that by using the iot platform from Tuya and enable the MQTT option.

Some of these devices also do not deliver up-to-date values when using polling. If you got such a device it could be that the device needs to be polled differently. This can be configured manually.Please do the following:
* Stop the tuya instance
* Use Admin on "Objects" tab and find the object with type "device" of the affected device. In this line in Admin Objects view click the pencil icon.
* In the JSON view of the object you see a "native" section. Add a new json key inside this native section:
```json
"native": {
    "useRefreshToGet": true,
    ...
}
```
* Save the object and restart the adapter and check if the values are updated now.

## Infrared Gateway features
There are different types of IR devices in the object tree

### The IR Gateway/Sender Devices
This is the real device you have as Hardware. This device is used by sub devices defined in the mobile App (see below) and can be used to learn and send custom IR codes.

The "ir-learn" state in this device is a Trigger which can be used to learn IR codes. The learned code is then received in the "202" state as base64 encoded Data.

The "ir-send" state can be used to send a base64 encoded IR code to the device. This can be used to send the learned code from the "ir-learn" state.

**This way to control only works on the "main IR device".**

### The IR Sub Devices
The IR sub devices have a lot of "ir-*" states wich are all buttons to trigger the respective Button/IR code. The ir states should match the layout of the buttons in the mobile App.

Some devices have combi-states like "M0_T20_S3" (found by a Daikin Air conditioner) which means Mode 0, Temperature 20 and (Fan)-Speed 3. In fact you need to choose the right button. Until now we did not found a generic/automated way to find out which button is which.
The mobile App itself also tries to remember these settings, so as soon you trigger anything with the adapter (or the real ir controller of the device) the information from the App is outdated.

## Scenes features
When the app cloud credentials are entered and stored then the adapter also reads out the scenes from the app and creates them as objects in the adapter. The scenes can be triggered by setting the scene state to true.

The triggering is then send to the cloud.

## Groups features
The adapter also reads out defined groups and creates corresponding states in the adapter. The group value is also polled from cloud and updated in the adapter.
When controlling groups this also is done via the cloud because else the group status will run out of sync.

## Converted/Enhanced Datapoints

The data from some datapoints are encoded and so needs to be decrypted and re-encrypted if allowed to change.

### Bitmap Fields
Some fields contain bitmaps, which means that they are a number and each bit in this number represents a state. The adapter converts these fields into substates like X-0 (for bit 0), X-1 (for bit 1) and so on. The label of the bit is set added to the name of the state.
Currently, bitfields are not writable.

### RGB Color states (IDs 24/5/colour/colour_data)
RGB Color datapoints are decoded into an object 5-rgb/24-rgb as RGB value in form "#rrggbb". The current color is decoded into that state and  can also be set by setting that state.
Make sure to use the correct mode of the lamp (white/color) because color is only relevant when the color mode is active.

### Power measurement states (IDs 5/6/7/phase_a/phase_b/phase_c)
The power measurement states are decoded into an object X-current, X-power and X-voltage. X-power is only having a value for some devices.
These states are not writable.

### Device Alarm states(IDs 17/alarm_set_2)
The alarm states are decoded into a 17-decoded object with a json as value. The JSON contains an array with the list of defined alarm types and their thresholds.
You can modify and set that JSON to change the alarm settings. The following alarm types are known (but maybe not all are supported by all devices):
* overcurrent
* three_phase_current_imbalance
* ammeter_overvoltage
* under_voltage
* three_phase_current_loss
* power_failure
* magnetic
* insufficient_balance
* arrears
* battery_overvoltage
* cover_open
* meter_cover_open
* fault

## Credits
The work of the adapter would not had been possible without the great work of @codetheweb, @kueblc and @NorthernMan54 (https://github.com/codetheweb/tuyapi) and https://github.com/clach04/python-tuya,https://github.com/uzlonewolf/tinytuya and many more.

## How to report issues and feature requests

Please use GitHub issues for this.

Best is to set the adapter to Debug log mode (Instances -> Expert mode -> Column Log level). Then please get the logfile from disk (subdirectory "log" in ioBroker installation directory and not from Admin because Admin cuts the lines). If you do not like providing it in GitHub issue you can also send it to me via email (iobroker@fischer-ka.de). Please add a reference to the relevant GitHub issue AND also describe what I see in the log at which time.

When there are issues with the Tuya App Cloud synchronisation then additional logging can be generatedf by the following process:
* Stop the adapter in Admin
* Open a shell on the ioBroker host
* execute `DEBUG=@tuyapi/cloud* iobroker debug tuya`
* get the log from the command line
Send the log with reference to the generated GitHub issue to iobroker@fischer-ka.de
